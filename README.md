# ENEI Events App 📅

This project was built for a presentation at **ENEI (National Meeting of Computer Engineering Students)** in partnership with **Blip** to introduce the basics of **React** and the **importance of testing**.

## 🎯 Purpose

A simple app that allows users to:

- View a list of events happening at ENEI
- Register the events they attended

The app was designed to explore:

- Core React concepts: **components, props, state**
- Project setup with **Vite**
- Implementation of different test levels:
  - **Unit tests**
  - **Integration tests**
  - **End-to-end (E2E) tests**

All using modern tools like **React Testing Library (RTL)**, **Vite**, and **Playwright**.
